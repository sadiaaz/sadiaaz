- 👋 Hi, I’m @sadiaaz
- 👀 I’m interested in Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pyhton 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on joining open-source projects, contributing to online communities, participating in hackathons,
- reaching out to startups or agencies needing development support, or even finding other developers to team up on personal projects to build your portfolio and network.
